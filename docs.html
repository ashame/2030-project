                    Site Overview
                </h2>
                <ul class="sourceList">
                    <li>
                        Welcome to Finder, your final destination on finding new places to eat.

                        To start out, you'll need to register for an account from the homepage. This allows you access to our ever-growing search form, with new features to be added in the future.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once you've made an account, you can enter a query (think pizza, sushi, etc) and a location (this can be a city, address, or something specific).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You'll shortly see a stack of cards appear on-screen. Click yes to view more about the restaurant, and no to dismiss it and move on to the next.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once you've gone through this stack, you'll be given an option to start a new search.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>
                        These following features were omitted due to time constraints / poor time management:
                        <ul class="sourceList">
                            <li>
                                Group creation - this would've allowed multiple users (hence registration requirement) to interact with each other / perform group queries with majority deciding on one location
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Messaging platform - this would've allowed messaging between registered user, and enable group discussions
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Image scraping - the intial idea with this was to use images provided via the Yelp API, but I was unable to find licensing information for these images, so they were omitted due to copyright concerns.
                            </li>
